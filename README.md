## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS custom properties and gradients to create visually appealing designs. I also improved my skills in responsive design using media queries.

```css
:root {
  --Pale-Violet: hsl(276, 100%, 81%);
  --Moderate-Violet: hsl(276, 55%, 52%);
  --Desaturated-Dark-Violet: hsl(271, 15%, 43%);
  --Grayish-Blue: hsl(206, 6%, 79%);
  --Very-Dark-Desaturated-Violet: hsl(271, 36%, 24%);
  --Dark-Grayish-Violet: hsl(270, 7%, 64%);
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my CSS skills, focusing on advanced layout techniques and animations. I also want to explore more about accessibility and how to make my projects more accessible to all users.
